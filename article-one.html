    <h1>BOSS ON TEAM STRENGTH AND GORDON FUTURE</h1>
    <h3>Fri 16 Sep 2022</h3></div>

    <div id="text">
        <p>Frank Lampard says he feels “strength and confidence” building in his Everton team and believes the Blues are ready to translate their encouraging performances into victories. <br>
            Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday’s clash with West Ham United at Goodison Park, Lampard also revealed the Club are in talks with Academy graduate Anthony Gordon over a new contract. <br>
            Everton go into the West Ham game on the back of four consecutive Premier League draws, with the Toffees unfortunate not to have gained more points from a series of purposeful and energetic displays. <br>
            Lampard says Everton’s solid defensive base has been a particular source of satisfaction – and expressed his belief the team can embark on a positive run of results. <br>
            “From where we were at the end of last season, we had to add through the core of the team [in the transfer market],” he explained. <br>
            “We’ve deserved more points than what we’ve got – that doesn’t mean anything but it’s nice to feel the confidence of being solid and feel like we’re going in the right direction. <br>
            “It can take time for certain elements of the team to grow but if we can keep more clean sheets – and be more tight and more difficult to beat – that’s a big starting point for us. <br>
            “We feel confident in ourselves, with the way we’re playing. We probably haven’t had the rub of the green here at Goodison. <br>
            “I feel we can see a strength within the team, but it can take time to translate the performances into results. <br>
            “We just have to keep working in the right direction and believe that will come.”</p>

            <p>
            Electric winger Gordon has made an impressive start to the campaign and has two goals to his name following strikes in 1-1 draws at Brentford and Leeds United. <br>
            Asked whether conversations over a new deal with the 20-year-old forward had started, Lampard said: “The Club are speaking with Anthony and Anthony’s people to see if we can get the right solution there.” <br>
            Gordon is one of several Everton players who will be on international duty over the coming fortnight, with the attacker joined in the England Under-21s squad by summer signing James Garner. <br>
            <b> Lampard says the midfielder, who joined the Blues from Manchester United on transfer deadline day, is in contention to make his Everton debut against West Ham. </b><br> <br> <br>
            “James is looking good,” Lampard said. “He’s trained really well. I’m a big fan of his as a player. I’m really pleased I’ve been able to bring him to the Club. <br> 
            “I like his attributes as a midfield player and I’ve been really happy to meet him as a lad. He’s now fit for selection and he gives us another option in midfield and a different type of option, with his qualities.” <br>
            Conor Coady and Nathan Patterson have also seen their fine Everton displays rewarded with call-ups to the senior England and Scotland squads respectively. <br>
            Blues boss Lampard saluted the pair’s early-season form. <br>
            “Conor’s been outstanding for us,” he said. <br>
            “He’s settled into the group brilliantly. He’s a proper professional and affects others around him. <br>
            “He’s also performed really well on the pitch. People associate him with a back five, but we’ve played a back four in past few games and him and James [Tarkowski] have been great in a pairing. It’s a pleasure to work with him. <br>
            “I’ve been really impressed with Nathan. His start to the season has been great. He needs to continue going in the same way. I think there is a lot more to come because he is such a young and developing player. <br>
            “I just want to help him get better and get more assists – he’s very good at joining in going forward. Defensively, I’ve been very pleased with his discipline and one-v-one defending against some top-class attackers. We’ll keep working with him but I’m very happy.” <br>
        </p>

        <p>Everton will lock horns with a West Ham side on Sunday who have won one of their six Premier League matches this term. <br>
            The Hammers, however, will make the trip to Goodison following back-to-back Europa Conference League victories. <br>
            On the threat West Ham will pose, Lampard said: “They have got a great coach in David Moyes and a very talented team, which they’ve shown in the past 18 months. They have lots of good individuals. <br>
            “Coming away from home, they are very good at being organised and they’ll be a real threat on the counter-attack, on set-pieces and through the speed in their team. They will be a very dangerous opponent.”</p>
